For further, if I give you 999999999 numbers, how can you do that?

With good Data Structure, you can organize your code in better way, sometimes it will help you:

- Spend less time for debugging, optimizing your code
- Become a better developer
- Run faster with the same hardware
- And it help you get better job/income.

For all those reasons, I t
